    "**NumPy in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing NumPy**: \n",
    "    To use NumPy, you need to import it. It is typically imported as `np`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NumPy Arrays**:\n",
    "    NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists but are more efficient for numerical computations. They are the core data structure of NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Creating an Array**:\n",
    "        - From a Python list:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        - With specific values:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        zeros = np.zeros(5)        # Creates an array of zeros\n",
    "        ones = np.ones(5)          # Creates an array of ones\n",
    "        full = np.full((2, 3), 7)  # Creates a 2x3 array filled with 7\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        - Random arrays:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        random_arr = np.random.rand(3, 3)  # 3x3 array with random values between 0 and 1\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Array Attributes**:\n",
    "    NumPy arrays have several useful attributes:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    arr.shape          # Tuple representing the dimensions of the array\n",
    "    arr.size           # Number of elements in the array\n",
    "    arr.ndim           # Number of dimensions (axes) of the array\n",
    "    arr.dtype          # Data type of the elements in the array\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Array Indexing and Slicing**:\n",
    "    NumPy arrays support indexing and slicing, similar to Python lists but with more advanced features.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n",
    "    arr[0]            # Access the first element\n",
    "    arr[1:4]          # Slice from index 1 to 3 (excluding 4)\n",
    "    arr[-1]           # Access the last element\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Array Operations**:\n",
    "    NumPy supports vectorized operations, meaning you can perform arithmetic on entire arrays without using loops.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "    result = arr1 + arr2  # Element-wise addition\n",
    "    result = arr1 * 2     # Multiply each element by 2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reshaping Arrays**:\n",
    "    You can change the shape of an array without changing its data using the `reshape()` function.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "    arr_reshaped = arr.reshape(2, 3)  # Reshape to a 2x3 matrix\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Broadcasting**:\n",
    "    NumPy arrays support broadcasting, which allows for element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes. Smaller arrays are \"broadcast\" over larger arrays to make their shapes compatible.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    arr2 = np.array([4])\n",
    "    result = arr1 + arr2  # Broadcasting arr2 to match arr1's shape\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Mathematical Functions**:\n",
    "    NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `log()`, `sqrt()`, and others.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    np.sin(arr)        # Apply sine function to each element\n",
    "    np.sqrt(arr)      # Apply square root function\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Linear Algebra**:\n",
    "    NumPy includes functions for linear algebra, such as matrix multiplication, determinant, eigenvalues, etc.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    mat1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "    mat2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "    product = np.dot(mat1, mat2)  # Matrix multiplication\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Statistical Operations**:\n",
    "    NumPy includes functions for basic statistical operations such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "    np.mean(arr)       # Mean of the array\n",
    "    np.median(arr)     # Median of the array\n",
    "    np.std(arr)        # Standard deviation of the array\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Random Module**:\n",
    "    NumPy has a submodule `numpy.random` to generate random numbers, random samples, or shuffle data.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    np.random.rand(3, 3)  # Random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1\n",
    "    np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(2, 3))  # Random integers between 0 and 9\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Array Concatenation and Splitting**:\n",
    "    NumPy provides functions to concatenate arrays along a specified axis and to split arrays.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "    concatenated = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))  # Concatenate arrays\n",
    "    split_arr = np.split(arr, 3)                  # Split array into 3 parts\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Saving and Loading Arrays**:\n",
    "    NumPy allows you to save arrays to a file and load them back later.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    np.save('array.npy', arr)           # Save array to a .npy file\n",
    "    loaded_arr = np.load('array.npy')   # Load array from a .npy file\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Advanced Indexing**:\n",
    "    You can index NumPy arrays in more advanced ways using boolean indexing and integer array indexing.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n",
    "    mask = arr > 30\n",
    "    result = arr[mask]  # Get elements greater than 30\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is highly efficient for numerical operations and forms the foundation of many other scientific libraries in Python, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.\n"
